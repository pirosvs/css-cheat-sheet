# css-cheat-sheet

## Description
-this project uses flexboxes to create a responsive site
-responsive layouts are important so that all functionality can be accessed no matter what device is being used
-may not always have access to certain devices or desktop size screen
-makes site legible at smaller sizes instead of getting cut off and not showing content or content getting endlessly smaller or overlapping -- basically becoming hard to impossible to actually read and therefore use
-also makes example of collaborative work with a shared repository and handling/ avoiding of merge conflicts

-skills used are html and advanced css (not only text color or family but gradients, transitions, flexbox, media queries, psuedo-elements [check if psuedo-class], etc), attention to needs of wide array of users/ devices, semantic html to improve site for screen readers, github and the use of a shared repository (thus uses communication and collaboration skills), and a gitignore file for collaboration standards
